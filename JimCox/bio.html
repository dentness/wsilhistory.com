    <h1>Jim Cox - Man of the Hour </h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="../images/jim_cox1.png" width="200" height="223" />A reward that I get from working on this website is the  opportunity to correspond with the local celebrities who made it all  happen.&nbsp; One such personality, Mr. Jim  Cox, allowed my family and me to visit him at the KEZK studios in St. Louis, where he  currently works as news director and morning anchor.&nbsp; My wife and children enjoyed the visit as  much as I did, and Jim was a gracious host.&nbsp;  We not only toured the radio station, but we were treated to some  hands-on training as Jim showed us how interviews were conducted in the  state-of-the-art production room.&nbsp; My  children, ages 7, 5, and 2 were &quot;interviewed&quot; by the man himself, and  were able to hear themselves as the tape was played back for them.&nbsp; We were given some actual news stories to  share during &quot;show and tell&quot; time and each of the kids received an  autographed picture. Jim also told us of his beginnings in radio, and later  granted me an interview via email...here it is:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Where were you born  and raised?&nbsp; </p>
    <p>I was born in Marion, my family moved to Pueblo, CO in 1940  because my father had relatives out there who said employment opportunities  were greater there than in southern Illinois.&nbsp;  We moved back to Marion  in 1948.&nbsp; I moved to Johnston City  in 1950 and&nbsp; graduated from JCHS in 1954. </p>
    <p><img src="../images/jim_cox2.png" width="261" height="301" /></p>
    <p>When did you become interested in a radio/communications  career?&nbsp; </p>
    <p>I was working my way through SIU at Carbondale as a night time janitor at a  building downtown.&nbsp; A housemate who was a  year ahead of me worked at a radio station in Murphysboro.&nbsp; On school holidays I would hang out with him  until 5:00 when I had to start cleaning the building.&nbsp; Finally, in 1956, I realized he had a better  way of attending college, and I decided that if he could work in radio, so  could I.&nbsp; After visiting several radio  stations within a few miles of Carbondale over  about a 6 month period, I finally was hired at WGGH in Marion in April of 1957. </p>
    <p>I will add here that Jim told me about the &quot;never give  up&quot; attitude he had when he was searching for a radio job.&nbsp; He was asked about his experience in radio  when visiting one of the stations one day.&nbsp;  Remarking that he had none, he also asked how he would get any  experience if that particular station wouldn't give him a &quot;shot&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some advice was given to him.......go home  and practice reading.&nbsp; In the days before  cassette recorders, those aspiring to be in the radio business had to practice  reading and &quot;train&quot; their voice. Since they couldn't offer a recorded  tape to would-be employers, they would have to read and &quot;audition&quot;  live for a radio station owner to take them seriously.&nbsp; Jim DID practice, going into a quiet room and  practicing in the corner with his hand up to his ear to hear his voice...for an  hour at a time!&nbsp; He also visited that  station, WGGH, every two weeks as he just &quot;happened&quot; to be in the area.&nbsp; His persistence paid off....and as you read  above, he was hired</p>
    <p>.<img src="../images/jim_cox3.png" width="265" height="308" /></p>
    <p>What was your educational experience before coming to  WSIL?&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;I was still attending  SIU as a speech major with an English minor on a parttime basis, having gotten  married in 1959, and decided to give TV a try.&nbsp;  I started there in December of 1961.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While at WSIL, what were your responsibilities?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;At a small station,  an employee does just about everything except sweep the floors.&nbsp; I wrote commercials and recorded them. I  anchored the 10:00 P.M. news, and serviced some accounts. My favorite job was  hosting &quot;The Hour,&quot; an hour-long variety/interview program five says  a week. </p>
    <p>I'm sure most people remember some of the famous people you  interviewed on &quot;The Hour&quot;.&nbsp;  Tell about some of the more memorable guests.</p>
    <p>I interviewed Jane Fonda during the 1972 Presidential  election when she was campaigning for George McGovern.&nbsp; I don't think she had been to Hanoi yet. She was  scheduled to make a speech at SIU, and they called to see if I would like to  interview her.&nbsp; Of course I said yes. She  had been on the speaking tour for a few weeks and was very hoarse, so I offered  her some tea.&nbsp; She gratefully accepted.<br />
      When we were on the air, she was calling President Nixon a  murderer and all sorts of off-the-wall names, almost as if she had memorized a  script (maybe written by acivist Tom Hayden, although I don't remember if they  actually were married at the time.)<br />
      During commercial breaks we chatted about our kids, and  other simple things.&nbsp; It was a big deal  for little old Harrisburg,  and the local newspaper editor and photographer were there.&nbsp; It was a big deal for little old Jimmy Cox  from Johnston City, too. </p>
    <p>and a little less controversial guest on &quot;The  Hour&quot;, Phyllis Diller!</p>
    <p>One of the joys of hosting The Hour was the opportunity to  interview celebrities when they would appear at the Du Quoin State Fair.&nbsp; Probably the funniest interview was with  Phyllis Diller in 1964. The closest top hotel at the time was the Holiday Inn  in Carbondale.  We set the camera up poolside about 10:30 in the morning and she came down in  the rattiest old housecoat you can imagine, with her hair in curlers and hair  net over her hair and another over her face and charmed us all.</p>
    <p>When did you leave WSIL and what have you done since  leaving? </p>
    <p>I left in 1974, worked for the National Federation of  Independent Business, a lobbying organization for small businesses, worked for  B.H. &amp; O. Chevrolet as advertising manager and in sales for about a year,  which was WORK, and decided it was time to get back into broadcasting.&nbsp; That's when I came to St. Louis.&nbsp;  I have been here in radio and tv since July of 1980, and my years at  WSIL provided a great training ground for success in this major market.</p>
    <p>Do you keep in touch with any of your WSIL colleagues?</p>
    <p>Yes, mostly by e-mail, but sometimes by phone.&nbsp; I keep in touch with Bill Plater, Robert  Unsell, and Bill Salus.&nbsp; My old friend  Lucky Leroy died about a year ago.</p>
    <p>Tell about your family and what you're up to these days.<img src="../images/jim_cox4.png" width="233" height="299" /></p>
    <p>I have 3 children.&nbsp;  Kevin has a doctorate&nbsp; in music  from the University of Illinois and is a clarinet professor and Director of  Bands at Missouri Baptist University  in St. Louis.  Cammy has a bachelor's in Psychology from SIU-Carbondale, and teaches and  counsels at the Job Corps in southern Illinois.&nbsp; She's married with two sons.&nbsp; Kara has a bachelor's in radio and tv from  SIU and is on radio and tv in Chicago.&nbsp; She also is married, but no kids, yet.</p>
    <p>I came to St. Louis  in 1980 and have worked in radio and tv, as well as being very active in the  &quot;free-lance&quot; industry in the '80s. Currently, I am the News Director  and morning anchor at what we call &quot;Soft-Rock, 102.5, KEZK.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Jim and his wife Carla live in St. Louis. Many thanks to Jim for his help  with this website.&nbsp; Many thanks for his  stories, his kindness, and friendship.&nbsp; </p>
