    <br />
    What were these men thinking?&nbsp; Harrisburg....  Illinois?&nbsp; Why in the world would someone build a  television station in a small, southern Illinois  town?&nbsp; This was a question asked by many  in the early 1950's when the Turner-Farrar Association decided to construct a  new station on Poplar street  in Harrisburg.
    <p>O.L. Turner was the head stockholder in the Turner-Farrar  Association.&nbsp; Both Turner and  Charles&nbsp; Farrar had fathers who were in  the movie theater business.&nbsp; O.L. Turner,  Sr. built a chain of movie theaters throughout Southern   Illinois that had done well for several years.&nbsp; Charles Farrar's father had also owned  theaters, and although a competitor with the elder Turner, eventually went in  to partnership with him.&nbsp; Both men were  said to be hard workers.&nbsp; Both were  shrewd and frugal businessmen.&nbsp; It is  said that the elder Mr. Turner and his wife would sell tickets, take tickets,  usher, and later operate the film projector.&nbsp;  The next morning, they would arrive at the theater to clean and get  ready for the next showing.&nbsp; It is  perhaps this work ethic that added to the success of the business.</p>
    <p>Another factor in the success of the business was Mr.  Turner's own business sense.&nbsp; He made  late night appointments with film salesman who directly called on theater  owners in those days.&nbsp; After talking for  an hour or more, the film salesman would wearily agree to a lower price on a  film.&nbsp; Mr. Turner's son, Oscar Jr.,  learned much from his father, becoming just as shrewd, hard-working, and  knowledgeable.&nbsp; He too carried on a long  workday and kept a close eye on the operations of the business.</p>
    <p>Television was a new and exciting medium in the late 1940&rsquo;s  and early 50&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Many people were  skeptical, but O.L. Turner Jr. was convinced that even small television  stations would drive the theater and radio industries out of business.&nbsp; He needed to strike while the iron was hot.</p>
    <p>Most television stations in those days were built in large  cities.&nbsp; St. Louis,  Chicago, and Indianapolis had television stations&hellip;..and large  populations.&nbsp; Would a small town of less  than 10,000 be a good place for a station?&nbsp;  Mr. Turner did not worry.&nbsp; He felt  that TV stations, despite any problems with installation or operating costs,  would and could exist in small towns&hellip;much like radio stations.&nbsp; He found out later that television, being  much different than radio, needed wide coverage and many viewers to survive.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Turner was  given UHF channel 22 by the FCC.&nbsp; This  would be the number for the new station, and it was soon determined that the  channel and the frequency themselves would be a hinderance.&nbsp; UHF channels provided limited coverage.&nbsp; The television signal from this frequency  followed the terrain, and with the hills and trees to contend with, much of the  area surrounding Harrisburg  would not be able to watch.&nbsp; The signal  was picked up in areas north of Harrisburg&hellip;.even  as far as 40 to 50 miles away.&nbsp; However,  even southern towns as close as the community of Vienna could not receive a strong  signal.&nbsp; This meant not enough people  would be watching&hellip;.not enough people to hear commercials.&nbsp; How would advertisers even be interested in  the station if no one was watching?&nbsp;&nbsp;  Another problem&hellip;.television sets weren&rsquo;t made for UHF reception!  Converters could be purchased and hooked to televisions.&nbsp; These converters would help viewers receive a  stronger signal.&nbsp; Many viewers opted to  mount tall television antennas on their homes.&nbsp;  Both the converters and the towers could be costly or impractical.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With problems  mounting, Mr. Turner decided to talk to the folks in Washington.&nbsp;  It took two years, but politicians soon realized that a UHF channel was  not practical for a small commercial station.&nbsp;  UHF channel 22 became VHF channel 3.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&hellip;&hellip;.And the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
