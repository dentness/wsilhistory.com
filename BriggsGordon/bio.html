    <p>Remember  &quot;cartoon eyes&quot;, &quot;Yessir, we're going to Sesser&quot;, and  &quot;KPOB...Poplar Bluff&quot;?&nbsp; These were just common sayings every night on  the Funny Company when Uncle Briggs took over for Cactus Pete.&nbsp; Characters such as &quot;Bananaman&quot;,  &quot;Sally Safety&quot;, </p>
    <p>and others were featured every evening.&nbsp; I remember watching The Three Stooges,  Charlie Chaplin, Deputy Dawg and others.&nbsp;  Remember when Uncle Briggs did his impression of Deputy Dawg's  sidekick.......what was his name?&nbsp; Was he  a muskrat?&nbsp; Anyway, I remember him saying  &quot;It's possibulll Depty Daaawwwg.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I actually got to visit the old WSIL station in 1978 and  watch the show.&nbsp; I remember how cluttered  the set was...out of camera range of course.&nbsp;  There were props and other things stuffed around the sides of the desk  and behind the backdrop.&nbsp; I remember the  news set being right next to the Funny Company set.....I was simply amazed at  how the station appeared in real life! For a 10 year-old, this was big  stuff.&nbsp; I got an autographed picture of  Uncle Briggs with Sally Safety.....and I also met him and shook his hand.&nbsp; I hope to find the picture soon and get it on  this site.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Uncle Briggs, played by a man in his twenties named Briggs  Gordan, could be heard on WEBQ radio after the Funny Company went off the  air.&nbsp; Before that, he could also be seen  in various reporting duties for WSIL news.&nbsp;  In the early 80's, Briggs Gordan passed away.&nbsp;&nbsp; He will be fondly remembered by many  &quot;kids&quot; who grew up in the 70's.</p>
