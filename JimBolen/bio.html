    <h1>Jim Bolen.. &quot;The First Cactus Pete&quot;</h1>

    <p>Jim Bolen achieved early fame as a member of the musical  group &quot;The Jim Bolen Trio&quot; at &quot;The Spinning Wheel&quot;, a  popular nightclub for students from Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.&nbsp; Jim and his trio played jazz, pre-rock and  roll, and dance tunes.&nbsp; When WSIL  television went on the air in December of 1953, Jim was on board as one of the  few staff members with previous television experience.&nbsp; Jim had worked at various stations, including  a station in Cincinnati.&nbsp; There, he played a character on a local  kiddie show that would inspire him to create &quot;Cactus Pete&quot;....who  went on the air that same evening in December.&nbsp;&nbsp;  According to Bill Plater, who later played the Cactus Pete character,  WSIL was &quot;very fortunate&quot; to have Jim Bolen as a staff member.&nbsp; He, as many others who worked there, was a  versatile performer.....doing jobs that ranged from newsman to talk show  host.&nbsp; After a few years, Bolen left WSIL  to join the staff of a new television station in Iowa.&nbsp;  He eventually wound up in St.    Louis at KMOX-TV where he served as a weatherman and  became a respected television personality in the area.&nbsp; He also continued his career in the  &quot;kiddie-show&quot; host arena by starring as a sailor in a show called &quot;Cookie  and the Captain&quot;.&nbsp; Jim Bolen is now  deceased, but is well remembered across Illinois  and Missouri  by many who watched.</p>
